In this folder you'll find code for the R package MicroBVS found in:

“MicroBVS: Dirichlet-Tree Multinomial Regression Models with Bayesian Variable Selection - an R Package”, by MD Koslovsky and M Vannucci 

The main functions operate in C++ via the R package Rcpp. These functions can be sourced by a set of wrapper functions that enable easy implementation of the code in the R environment. Various functions are available that produce, summarize, and plot the results for inference.  

This package relies on various R packages that need to be installed in the R environment before running. To install, use the install.packages(‘’) command for the following packages:
Rcpp 
RcppArmadillo  
MCMCpack
mvtnorm 
ggplot2
devtools
ape
igraph

Then to install the DMLMbvs package, simply run 

library(devtools)
install_github( "mkoslovsky/MicroBVS", build_vignettes = TRUE)

in the R console.
